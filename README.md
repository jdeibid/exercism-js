# Exercism-JS

![GitHub commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/w/jdeibid/exercism-js?style=flat-square)

This repo contains the solved exercises of the JavaScript path in [Exercism](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/javascript). 

Besides serving as practice for this language, I hope it will also serve to improve my skills with Git and repository management. All the exercises uploaded here, have already been sent to [Exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/jdeibid). 

Also, I will try to update this repository on a daily or interday basis, as well as refactor my code once I finish all the exercises.

## Improvements

In case that you have a better solution for any of this exercises, you can open an issue for that.
